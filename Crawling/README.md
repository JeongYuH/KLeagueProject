# K-League Data Collection (Crawling)

## Overview

In this phase of the project, we will collect K-League match data from reliable sources to use for subsequent analysis. The data collected will include information such as match date, team details, player statistics, goals scored, goals conceded, and match outcomes. This step is essential as it provides the raw data needed for our analysis and the creation of new performance metrics.

## Steps

1. **Source Selection**: Identify and select the data source(s) for K-League match data. Possible sources may include the official K-League website or trusted soccer data providers.

2. **Web Crawling**: Use web scraping techniques to extract match data from the selected source(s). Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium can be employed for this purpose.

3. **Data Retrieval**: Collect data for a specified time period or range of matches. Ensure that the data obtained is comprehensive and accurate.

4. **Data Storage**: Save the collected data in an appropriate format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or Excel, for further processing and analysis.

## Considerations

- Be respectful of the terms of use and policies of the selected data source(s). Ensure compliance with any legal requirements related to web scraping and data usage.

- Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with any potential issues during the web crawling process, such as connection errors or changes in the website's structure.

- Regularly update the dataset to ensure it includes the most recent K-League match data.

## Example Code (Python)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Define the URL of the K-League match data source
url = '[https://example.com/k-league-match-data](https://data.kleague.com/)'

# Send an HTTP request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    # Extract match data and save it to a CSV file
    # (Code for data extraction and storage may vary based on the website's structure)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve K-League match data. Please check the data source.")
