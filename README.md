# K-League Data Analysis for Creating New Metrics

## Project Overview

This project combines data crawling and analysis to develop innovative performance metrics for the K-League (Korean Professional Football League). These new metrics aim to provide fresh insights into team and player performance, enhancing our understanding of K-League soccer matches.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection (Crawling)**
    - Collect match data from reliable sources such as the K-League official website or other trusted soccer data sources.
    - Required data elements: match date, team information, player information, goals scored, goals conceded, match outcomes, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Clean and preprocess the collected data.
    - Perform tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

3. **Data Storage**
    - Store the preprocessed data in an appropriate format, typically CSV, Excel, or a database.

4. **Data Analysis**
    - Explore and analyze the data to identify potential areas for creating new performance metrics.
    - Utilize statistical techniques to develop and refine metrics that offer unique insights into K-League matches.

5. **Metric Validation**
    - Validate the new metrics by applying them to historical data and assessing their effectiveness.
    - Ensure that the metrics are meaningful, statistically sound, and relevant to the K-League context.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**
    - Visualize the new metrics and their impact on understanding K-League matches.
    - Create comprehensive reports and interactive visualizations to present the findings and insights to stakeholders.

7. **Interpretation and Future Directions**
    - Interpret the results of the new metrics and consider how they can enhance soccer analytics, team strategies, and fan engagement.
    - Explore opportunities for real-time application of the metrics during matches.

8. **Integration with K-League Ecosystem (Optional)**
    - Investigate the possibility of integrating the new metrics with official K-League platforms or team management systems.
    - Collaborate with K-League stakeholders to explore how the metrics can benefit the league.

## Tools to Use

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Crawling**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium (for web crawling)
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistical Analysis**: scipy, numpy (if needed)

## Schedule

- Develop a project schedule outlining the timeline for each phase and task.

## Team Composition (Optional)

- Assemble a project team and assign roles and responsibilities.

## Data Licensing and Legal Considerations

- Ensure compliance with data licensing agreements and legal considerations related to data usage.

## Deliverables

- Documentation of the new metrics and their calculation methods.
- Reports and visualizations showcasing the impact of the new metrics on K-League analysis.
- Code and data repository for transparency, reproducibility, and future reference.

## References

- Refer to existing soccer analytics literature and methodologies for inspiration.

## Project Validation

- Seek feedback and validation from soccer experts or analysts to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the new metrics.

## Project Completion

- Conclude the project by sharing the newly created metrics and their potential applications with the relevant stakeholders.
  
This revised project plan combines the elements of the previous plans and focuses on creating innovative performance metrics for the K-League, emphasizing the importance of validation, visualization, and potential integration with the K-League ecosystem.
